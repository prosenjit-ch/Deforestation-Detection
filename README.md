# Deforestation-Detection
Satellite image segmentation using deep learning for deforestation detection


**Problem Statement**

Deforestation poses a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and sustainable development, particularly in regions like Rangamati. Despite conservation efforts, monitoring vast forested areas remains a daunting task. Traditional methods of monitoring rely heavily on manual observation, making them inefficient and often inaccurate. To address this challenge, the project aims to develop a Deforestation Detection System for Rangamati.
